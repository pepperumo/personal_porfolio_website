# Story 1.1: Extract CV Content from Text for AI Knowledge Base

## Status: Ready for Review

## Story

As a system,
I want to automatically extract and structure content from the CV text file,
so that the AI has current information about skills, experience, and projects to answer questions.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Automated script extracts text content from CV text file stored in repository
2. Content is structured into categories (skills, experience, projects, education, contact)
3. Text extraction runs without affecting existing portfolio functionality
4. Extracted content is formatted for embedding generation and saved as JSON
5. Process can be triggered manually and via API endpoints
6. Content validation ensures completeness and handles text formatting variations

## Epic

This story is part of Epic 1: Foundation & Core Integration

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Analyze CV text structure and content format
- [x] Create text extraction script using regex parsing
- [x] Structure extracted content into AI-readable categories
- [x] Format content for embedding generation and save as cv_structured.json and cv_ai_content.json
- [x] Add manual trigger mechanism via trigger_cv_extraction.py script
- [x] Create API endpoints (/cv-content GET, /extract-cv POST) for content access
- [x] Add content validation checks via validate_cv_content.py
- [x] Test extraction without affecting portfolio functionality

## Definition of Done

- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] Content extraction working
- [x] Portfolio functionality preserved
- [x] Content properly structured
- [x] Validation passing

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

GitHub Copilot (Claude-based)

### Debug Log References

- Successfully created CV content extraction system using text parsing instead of PDF
- Implemented regex-based parsing for structured content extraction
- Created API endpoints for content serving
- All tests and validation passing

### Completion Notes List

1. **Implementation Approach Changed**: Switched from PDF extraction to text file parsing for better reliability and performance
2. **Files Created**:
   - `backend/cv_content_extractor.py` - Core extraction logic with CVContentExtractor class
   - `backend/trigger_cv_extraction.py` - Manual trigger script for content processing
   - `backend/validate_cv_content.py` - Content validation and readiness checks
3. **API Integration**: Added `/cv-content` GET and `/extract-cv` POST endpoints to FastAPI app
4. **Output Files Generated**:
   - `backend/data/cv_structured.json` - Complete structured CV data
   - `backend/data/cv_ai_content.json` - AI-optimized content chunks (8 sections, 12,243 characters)
5. **Content Statistics**:
   - 6 professional positions extracted
   - 7 projects documented
   - 4 education entries
   - 6 languages
   - 8 certificates
   - Content ready for vectorization with sentence-transformers

### File List

- backend/cv_content_extractor.py (new)
- backend/trigger_cv_extraction.py (new)
- backend/validate_cv_content.py (new)
- backend/app.py (modified - added CV endpoints)
