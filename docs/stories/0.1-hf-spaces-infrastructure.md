# Story 0.1: Set Up Hugging Face Spaces Infrastructure

## Status: Draft

## Story

As a developer,
I want to create and configure the Hugging Face Spaces backend infrastructure,
so that I have a reliable, zero-cost AI processing platform for PeppeGPT.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Hugging Face Spaces app is created with appropriate Python environment
2. Basic health check endpoint responds with system status
3. Environment supports sentence-transformers and conversational AI models
4. Spaces configuration documented for deployment automation
5. API structure supports the defined data contracts from frontend architecture
6. Free-tier resource limits are configured and monitored
