# Story 0.2: Implement Environment Configuration and API Setup

## Status: Ready for Review

## Story

As a system,
I want proper environment variable management and API endpoint configuration,
so that the frontend can securely connect to the backend across environments.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Environment variables configured for API endpoint URLs ✓
2. CORS headers properly configured for GitHub Pages origin ✓
3. API rate limiting implemented to respect Hugging Face free-tier ✓
4. Error response format matches frontend architecture specification ✓
5. Configuration supports both development and production environments ✓
6. Fallback NOOP responder implemented for missing environment configuration ✓

## Epic

This story is part of Epic 0: Infrastructure & Deployment Setup

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Set up environment variable configuration system
- [x] Configure CORS for GitHub Pages domain
- [x] Implement API rate limiting middleware
- [x] Create standardized error response format
- [x] Set up development vs production environment configs
- [x] Implement fallback NOOP responder
- [x] Test environment configuration across deployments

## Definition of Done

- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] CORS working from GitHub Pages
- [x] Rate limiting prevents abuse
- [x] Error responses follow standard format
- [x] Environment configs documented

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used: GPT-4

### Debug Log References

- Fixed pydantic_settings import issue for BaseSettings
- Resolved test failures for rate limiting and mocking
- Environment variable validation working across development/production modes

### Completion Notes

- Environment configuration system implemented with pydantic-settings
- CORS properly configured for GitHub Pages (`https://pepperumo.github.io`) and development origins
- Rate limiting middleware with sliding window implementation (100 requests/hour)
- Standardized error response format with type, message, timestamp, details
- Development vs production environment detection with appropriate settings
- Fallback NOOP responder for chat and search endpoints when AI services unavailable
- Comprehensive test coverage (21 passed, 1 skipped)
