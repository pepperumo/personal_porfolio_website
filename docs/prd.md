# PeppeGPT Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Enable technical recruiters to quickly find relevant information about your skills and experience
- Reduce time-to-insight for portfolio visitors through conversational interface
- Automatically maintain up-to-date AI responses when portfolio content changes
- Achieve zero operational costs by leveraging free-tier services
- Provide 80% accuracy in answering basic questions about your professional background

### Background Context

Technical recruiters face time constraints when reviewing candidate portfolios, often missing critical information or skipping candidates entirely due to inefficient information discovery. Traditional portfolio websites require manual navigation through multiple sections to understand a candidate's qualifications, creating friction in the recruitment process.

PeppeGPT addresses this challenge by providing an AI-powered conversational interface that allows recruiters to ask natural language questions about your skills, experience, and projects. The solution leverages Hugging Face's free-tier AI models and integrates seamlessly with your existing portfolio hosted on GitHub Pages, ensuring zero operational costs while providing immediate, contextual responses about your professional background.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The chat interface should feel like a natural conversation with a knowledgeable assistant who has deep familiarity with the portfolio owner's professional background. The experience should be lightweight, fast, and focused on helping recruiters quickly find the information they need without overwhelming them with unnecessary complexity.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Conversational Interface**: Simple text input with immediate AI responses
- **Suggested Questions**: Pre-populated common questions to guide users
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Brief initial answers with options to dive deeper
- **Mobile-First Design**: Touch-friendly interface optimized for various screen sizes

### Core Screens and Views

- **Chat Widget**: Floating or embedded chat interface on portfolio pages
- **Conversation View**: Main chat interface showing question/answer history
- **Quick Actions**: Suggested questions related to skills, experience, projects
- **Minimized State**: Collapsed widget that doesn't interfere with portfolio browsing

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

The chat interface must meet WCAG AA standards including keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, appropriate color contrast, and alt text for any visual elements.

### Branding

The chat widget should complement the existing portfolio design without competing for attention. Use consistent typography, color palette, and spacing that matches the current portfolio aesthetic while clearly identifying itself as an interactive AI assistant.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primarily web-based responsive design that works seamlessly across desktop computers, tablets, and mobile phones. The interface should adapt gracefully to different screen sizes while maintaining full functionality.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

The PeppeGPT functionality will be integrated into the existing portfolio repository structure, adding AI chat capabilities without requiring separate repository management.

### Service Architecture

**Hybrid Architecture**: Frontend React component integrated with portfolio + Serverless backend via Hugging Face Spaces. The chat widget operates as a client-side component that communicates with Hugging Face's API infrastructure for AI processing, maintaining the zero-cost requirement.

### Testing Requirements

**Unit + Integration Testing**: Implement unit tests for React components and integration tests for the AI service communication. Manual testing for user experience validation and accuracy of AI responses to ensure the 80% accuracy requirement is met.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **Hugging Face Models**: Utilize sentence-transformers for embedding generation and a lightweight conversational AI model for response generation
- **Content Sync**: Implement automated content extraction from portfolio HTML/React components to keep AI knowledge current
- **PDF Processing**: Utilize PyPDF2 or similar library for text extraction from CV PDF files
- **Content Sync**: Monitor CV PDF file changes via GitHub repository updates for automatic re-processing
- **State Management**: Simple local state management for chat history without persistence (aligns with no conversation memory requirement)
- **API Rate Limits**: Design with Hugging Face free-tier rate limits in mind, implementing graceful degradation if limits are exceeded
- **Deployment**: Leverage GitHub Actions for automated deployment to both GitHub Pages (frontend) and Hugging Face Spaces (backend processing)
