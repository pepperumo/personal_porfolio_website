# User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The chat interface should feel like a natural conversation with a knowledgeable assistant who has deep familiarity with the portfolio owner's professional background. The experience should be lightweight, fast, and focused on helping recruiters quickly find the information they need without overwhelming them with unnecessary complexity.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Conversational Interface**: Simple text input with immediate AI responses
- **Suggested Questions**: Pre-populated common questions to guide users
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Brief initial answers with options to dive deeper
- **Mobile-First Design**: Touch-friendly interface optimized for various screen sizes

### Core Screens and Views

- **Chat Widget**: Floating or embedded chat interface on portfolio pages
- **Conversation View**: Main chat interface showing question/answer history
- **Quick Actions**: Suggested questions related to skills, experience, projects
- **Minimized State**: Collapsed widget that doesn't interfere with portfolio browsing

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

The chat interface must meet WCAG AA standards including keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, appropriate color contrast, and alt text for any visual elements.

### Branding

The chat widget should complement the existing portfolio design without competing for attention. Use consistent typography, color palette, and spacing that matches the current portfolio aesthetic while clearly identifying itself as an interactive AI assistant.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primarily web-based responsive design that works seamlessly across desktop computers, tablets, and mobile phones. The interface should adapt gracefully to different screen sizes while maintaining full functionality.
