# Epic 0: Infrastructure & Deployment Setup

Establish the foundational infrastructure for PeppeGPT including Hugging Face Spaces backend setup, CI/CD pipelines, environment configuration, and rollback capabilities to ensure safe brownfield integration.

### Story 0.1: Set Up Hugging Face Spaces Infrastructure

As a developer,
I want to create and configure the Hugging Face Spaces backend infrastructure,
so that I have a reliable, zero-cost AI processing platform for PeppeGPT.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Hugging Face Spaces app is created with appropriate Python environment
2. Basic health check endpoint responds with system status
3. Environment supports sentence-transformers and conversational AI models
4. Spaces configuration documented for deployment automation
5. API structure supports the defined data contracts from frontend architecture
6. Free-tier resource limits are configured and monitored

### Story 0.2: Implement Environment Configuration and API Setup

As a system,
I want proper environment variable management and API endpoint configuration,
so that the frontend can securely connect to the backend across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Environment variables configured for API endpoint URLs
2. CORS headers properly configured for GitHub Pages origin
3. API rate limiting implemented to respect Hugging Face free-tier
4. Error response format matches frontend architecture specification
5. Configuration supports both development and production environments
6. Fallback NOOP responder implemented for missing environment configuration

### Story 0.3: Create CI/CD Pipeline for Dual Deployment

As a developer,
I want automated deployment pipelines for both GitHub Pages and Hugging Face Spaces,
so that updates can be deployed safely without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. GitHub Actions workflow deploys frontend to GitHub Pages
2. Automated deployment pipeline for Hugging Face Spaces backend
3. Environment-specific configuration management
4. Deployment validation tests ensure both services are operational
5. Rollback procedures documented and tested
6. Version synchronization between frontend and backend maintained

### Story 0.4: Implement Feature Flag and Rollback Strategy

As a portfolio owner,
I want the ability to safely enable/disable the chat widget and rollback changes,
so that my existing portfolio functionality is never compromised.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Environment variable controls chat widget visibility
2. Widget can be completely disabled without breaking portfolio
3. Feature flag implementation allows gradual rollout
4. Rollback procedure removes all chat widget traces
5. Bundle size monitoring ensures performance impact limits
6. Documentation includes step-by-step rollback instructions
