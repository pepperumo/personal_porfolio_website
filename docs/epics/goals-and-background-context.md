# Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Enable technical recruiters to quickly find relevant information about your skills and experience
- Reduce time-to-insight for portfolio visitors through conversational interface
- Automatically maintain up-to-date AI responses when portfolio content changes
- Achieve zero operational costs by leveraging free-tier services
- Provide 80% accuracy in answering basic questions about your professional background

### Background Context

Technical recruiters face time constraints when reviewing candidate portfolios, often missing critical information or skipping candidates entirely due to inefficient information discovery. Traditional portfolio websites require manual navigation through multiple sections to understand a candidate's qualifications, creating friction in the recruitment process.

PeppeGPT addresses this challenge by providing an AI-powered conversational interface that allows recruiters to ask natural language questions about your skills, experience, and projects. The solution leverages Hugging Face's free-tier AI models and integrates seamlessly with your existing portfolio hosted on GitHub Pages, ensuring zero operational costs while providing immediate, contextual responses about your professional background.
