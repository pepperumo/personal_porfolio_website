# Epic 2: AI Processing & Knowledge Base

Implement the core AI functionality including semantic search, response generation, and automated content synchronization to create an intelligent conversational assistant, building on the established infrastructure.

### Story 2.1: Implement Semantic Search with Embeddings

As a system,
I want to use sentence embeddings to find relevant portfolio content,
so that AI responses are grounded in actual portfolio information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Portfolio content is converted to embeddings using sentence-transformers
2. User questions are embedded and matched against content embeddings
3. Semantic search returns most relevant content sections for queries
4. Search results include confidence scores and content source references
5. Embedding generation and search operations complete within performance requirements
6. Memory usage optimized for Hugging Face free-tier constraints

### Story 2.2: Integrate Conversational AI Model

As a user,
I want to receive natural language responses to my questions,
so that I can understand the portfolio owner's background through conversation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Conversational AI model generates responses based on retrieved content
2. Responses are contextual and directly address user questions
3. Answers maintain professional tone appropriate for recruiter audience
4. System handles questions outside portfolio scope with appropriate responses
5. Response generation operates within Hugging Face free-tier constraints
6. Model selection optimized for accuracy and speed balance

### Story 2.3: Implement Content Synchronization Pipeline

As a portfolio owner,
I want the AI knowledge to update automatically when I change portfolio content,
so that responses remain current without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Content extraction triggers when portfolio is updated via GitHub Actions
2. New embeddings are generated for changed content within 24 hours
3. Synchronization process runs without manual intervention
4. System handles content additions, modifications, and deletions
5. Sync status and timestamps are tracked and accessible
6. Version control integration ensures content consistency

### Story 2.4: Add Response Quality and Confidence Scoring

As a recruiter,
I want to receive accurate and relevant answers with confidence indicators,
so that I can make informed decisions about the candidate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. System validates response quality before delivery
2. Confidence scoring helps filter low-quality responses
3. Fallback responses handle questions with insufficient information
4. Response accuracy meets 80% target for basic professional questions
5. Quality metrics are tracked and reportable
6. Sources cited for generated responses with confidence levels
