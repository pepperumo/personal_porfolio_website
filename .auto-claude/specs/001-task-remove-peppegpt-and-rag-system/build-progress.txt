=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: Remove PeppeGPT Chat and RAG System
Workspace: personal_porfolio_website
Started: 2025-12-27

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: Systematic feature removal requiring coordinated changes across frontend, backend directories, CI/CD pipeline, and configuration files. Follows feature workflow pattern to ensure no orphaned references remain.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Phases: 6
- Total subtasks: 12
- Created init.sh

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Delete Chat and Backend Directories): 3 subtasks, depends on []
  - Delete src/features/chat/ directory
  - Delete backend/ directory
  - Delete hf/ directory

- Phase 2 (Clean Frontend Files): 2 subtasks, depends on [phase-1]
  - Clean App.js (remove chat imports, ChatProvider, ChatDisplay, isChatEnabled)
  - Clean Home.js (remove ProminentChatButton, useChat, toggleChat)

- Phase 3 (Clean Test Files): 1 subtask, depends on [phase-2]
  - Clean App.integration.test.js (remove ChatPanel mock, chat test cases)

- Phase 4 (Clean Configuration Files): 1 subtask, depends on [phase-2]
  - Update version.json (remove backend_version, deployment_target.backend, urls.backend)

- Phase 5 (Clean CI/CD Pipeline): 1 subtask, depends on [phase-1]
  - Update deploy.yml (remove backend-test, deploy-backend, backend validation)

- Phase 6 (Build and Test Verification): 4 subtasks, depends on [phase-2, phase-3, phase-4, phase-5]
  - Run npm build
  - Run npm test
  - Verify no chat references
  - Validate CI/CD YAML

Services Involved:
- frontend: React portfolio application - chat components to be removed from App.js and Home.js
- backend: FastAPI backend (to be deleted entirely)
- ci/cd: GitHub Actions workflow - backend jobs to be removed

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 3
- Recommended workers: 1 (sequential recommended for simplicity)
- Parallel groups:
  * [phase-2-frontend-cleanup, phase-5-cicd-cleanup] - Both depend only on phase-1, different file sets
  * [phase-3-test-cleanup, phase-4-config-cleanup] - Both depend on phase-2, different file sets

Critical Path:
1. phase-1-delete-directories
2. phase-2-frontend-cleanup
3. phase-3-test-cleanup
4. phase-6-verification

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 001 --parallel 1

Example:
  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 001 --parallel 1

=== VERIFICATION STRATEGY ===

Risk Level: medium
Test Types Required: unit, integration

Acceptance Criteria:
- All three directories deleted (src/features/chat/, backend/, hf/)
- App.js and Home.js render without chat components
- No broken imports detected during build
- All remaining tests pass
- CI/CD workflow is valid YAML
- No chat references remain in src/ directory

=== PLANNER NOTES ===

CRITICAL:
- Directory deletions MUST complete before file modifications to prevent import resolution errors
- Chat removal must be complete - partial removal will cause build failures
- REACT_APP_CHAT_ENABLED checks exist in both App.js and Home.js - both must be removed
- deploy-frontend and validate-deployment jobs have backend dependencies that must be updated

=== END SESSION 1 ===

=== SESSION 2: Build Verification ===
Date: 2025-12-27

Subtask: subtask-6-1 - Run npm build to verify no broken imports

Environment Note: npm commands are blocked in this sandboxed environment.
Manual verification performed instead:

MANUAL VERIFICATION RESULTS:
✅ All App.js imports verified (10 components):
   - ./styles/GlobalStyles ✓
   - ./components/Navigation/Navbar ✓
   - ./components/Home/Home ✓
   - ./components/Experience/Experience ✓
   - ./components/Education/Education ✓
   - ./components/Portfolio/Portfolio ✓
   - ./components/Languages/Languages ✓
   - ./components/Skills/Skills ✓
   - ./components/Contact/Contact ✓
   - ./components/SocialSidebar/SocialSidebar ✓
   - ./components/ThreeBackground/ThreeBackground ✓

✅ No chat references in src/ directory (grep verified)
✅ App.js clean - no ChatProvider, ChatDisplay, or chat imports
✅ Home.js clean - no ProminentChatButton, useChat, or toggleChat
✅ Deleted directories confirmed removed:
   - src/features/chat/ ✓ (not found)
   - backend/ ✓ (not found)
   - hf/ ✓ (not found)

RECOMMENDATION: Full npm run build should be executed in CI/CD pipeline
or locally by developer to complete full production build verification.

=== END SESSION 2 ===

=== SESSION 3: Test Verification ===
Date: 2025-12-27

Subtask: subtask-6-2 - Run npm test to verify all remaining tests pass

Environment Note: npm commands blocked in sandboxed environment.
Manual verification performed instead:

TEST FILES VERIFIED:
✅ src/App.test.js - Clean, tests basic App rendering
   - Mocks ThreeBackground component correctly
   - Renders App and verifies three-background test ID

✅ src/App.integration.test.js - Clean, tests integration
   - Mocks ThreeBackground component correctly
   - Tests main portfolio components render
   - Tests lazy loading performance (1 second budget)

TEST CONFIGURATION VERIFIED:
✅ setupTests.js - Comprehensive test setup:
   - @testing-library/jest-dom imported
   - IntersectionObserver mocked
   - ResizeObserver mocked
   - WebGL context mocked for Three.js
   - Console errors suppressed for WebGL warnings

✅ package.json test dependencies present:
   - @testing-library/jest-dom ^6.6.3
   - @testing-library/react ^16.2.0
   - @testing-library/dom ^10.4.0
   - @testing-library/user-event ^13.5.0

NO REMOVED COMPONENT REFERENCES:
✅ grep verified: No PeppeGPT, ChatInterface, ChatToggle, chatService, ragService references

RECOMMENDATION: Full npm test should be executed in CI/CD pipeline
or locally by developer to complete full test execution verification.

=== END SESSION 3 ===

=== SESSION 4: Chat Reference Verification ===
Date: 2025-12-27

Subtask: subtask-6-3 - Verify no remaining chat references in codebase

VERIFICATION COMMAND OUTPUT:
$ grep -r 'features/chat\|REACT_APP_CHAT' src/ || echo 'No chat references found'
Result: "No chat references found" ✅

EXTENDED VERIFICATION:
$ grep -ri 'chat\|peppegpt\|rag' src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx"
Result: Only content strings found (portfolio project descriptions, experience text)
  - "supply chain" in Experience.js (business context, not code)
  - "Agentic RAG on n8n" in Portfolio.js (project description, not implementation)
  - No actual chat feature code references ✅

DIRECTORY CHECK:
$ ls -la src/features/
Result: Directory exists but is empty (chat subdirectory removed) ✅

VERIFICATION STATUS: PASSED ✅
All chat feature code references have been successfully removed from the codebase.
